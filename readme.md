# Frontend.js

Frontend.js is a tiny, dependency-free framework for composing web pages from reusable HTML fragments and creating reactive data driven pages.

It uses the <fragment> element with a src attribute to include external pieces of markup directly in your page, letting you assemble complete layouts from modular parts without any build step or framework overhead. Each fragment remains a valid, standalone HTML file â€” making your site natively composable, inspectable, and portable.

Alongside composition, Frontend.js provides a minimal state and data layer for simple reactive behavior. Changes to data emit clear, structured events that update bound elements or trigger custom logic, allowing dynamic pages and live UI updates without hidden watchers or virtual DOMs.
